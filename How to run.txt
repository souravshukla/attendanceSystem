# Create a new environment
Step 1 : open your anaconda prompt (for windows user search inside start menu )
                                   (for Ubuntu and Mac user you can open your terminal)

Step 2 : Create a new environment
                command : conda create -n facerecognition python==3.6.9
Step 3 : activate your environment
                conda activate facerecognition
Step 4 : Install requirements.txt in the newly created environment
            a). Navigate to your folder location on anaconda prompt/teminal
                    for me ( /PycharmProjects/FaceRecogAcademy )
                    for your folderName
            b). Check if we have requirements.txt or not in the current directory

                    command : for windows (dir)
                              for Mac/Ubuntu(ls)
                    datasets,  How to run.txt,  requirements.txt,  src

                    you should see the above mentioned name of files.

                    if yes:
                        Your are good to go
                    elif No:
                        Please check the steps again you must have missed something

Step 5 : Installation and setup is done:
         a).  cd src
